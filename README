Using TinyCC to compile Linux kernels,
Testing tcc compilation speed and correctness.
Studying Linux kernel internals.and Linux kernel development.

Original author of the tccboot project is Fabrice Bellard:
TCCBOOT: TinyCC Boot Loader (www.bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html)

Project considered as finished. tcc is quite good to compile
linux-2.4.37.11 kernel with PCnet-PCI II ethernet driver.
A telnet from tccboot to other host is possible.

A kernel compilation is performed in 8 seconds:

 38402 idents, 6737645 lines, 196142735 bytes, 7.285 s, 924836 lines/s, 26.9 MB/s
 (a tcc compiled by gcc)

 38402 idents, 6737645 lines, 196142735 bytes, 9.392 s, 717400 lines/s, 20.9 MB/s
 (a tcc compiled by tcc)

Now an attempt to compile openvz_rhel6_kernel_mirror by tcc is
started.
